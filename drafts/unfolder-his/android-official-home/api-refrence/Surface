Surface
public class Surface 
extends Object implements Parcelable

java.lang.Object
   â†³	android.view.Surface

Handle onto a raw buffer that is being managed by the screen compositor.

A Surface is generally created by or from a consumer of image buffers (such as a SurfaceTexture, MediaRecorder, or Allocation), and is handed to some kind of producer (such as OpenGL, MediaPlayer, or CameraDevice) to draw into.

Note: A Surface acts like a weak reference to the consumer it is associated with. By itself it will not keep its parent consumer from being reclaimed.
