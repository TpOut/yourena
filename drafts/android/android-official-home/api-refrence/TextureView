A TextureView can be used to display a content stream. Such a content stream can for instance be a video or an OpenGL scene. The content stream can come from the application's process as well as a remote process.

TextureView can only be used in a hardware accelerated window. When rendered in software, TextureView will draw nothing.

Unlike SurfaceView, TextureView does not create a separate window but behaves as a regular View. This key difference allows a TextureView to be moved, transformed, animated, etc. For instance, you can make a TextureView semi-translucent by calling myView.setAlpha(0.5f).

Using a TextureView is simple: all you need to do is get its SurfaceTexture. The SurfaceTexture can then be used to render content. The following example demonstrates how to render the camera preview into a TextureView:

  public class LiveCameraActivity extends Activity implements TextureView.SurfaceTextureListener {
      private Camera mCamera;
      private TextureView mTextureView;

      protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
          super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);

          mTextureView = new TextureView(this);
          mTextureView.setSurfaceTextureListener(this);

          setContentView(mTextureView);
      }

      public void onSurfaceTextureAvailable(SurfaceTexture surface, int width, int height) {
          mCamera = Camera.open();

          try {
              mCamera.setPreviewTexture(surface);
              mCamera.startPreview();
          } catch (IOException ioe) {
              // Something bad happened
          }
      }

      public void onSurfaceTextureSizeChanged(SurfaceTexture surface, int width, int height) {
          // Ignored, Camera does all the work for us
      }

      public boolean onSurfaceTextureDestroyed(SurfaceTexture surface) {
          mCamera.stopPreview();
          mCamera.release();
          return true;
      }

      public void onSurfaceTextureUpdated(SurfaceTexture surface) {
          // Invoked every time there's a new Camera preview frame
      }
  }
 
A TextureView's SurfaceTexture can be obtained either by invoking getSurfaceTexture() or by using a TextureView.SurfaceTextureListener. It is important to know that a SurfaceTexture is available only after the TextureView is attached to a window (and onAttachedToWindow() has been invoked.) It is therefore highly recommended you use a listener to be notified when the SurfaceTexture becomes available.

It is important to note that only one producer can use the TextureView. For instance, if you use a TextureView to display the camera preview, you cannot use lockCanvas() to draw onto the TextureView at the same time.
